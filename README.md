Android Ant colony Simulator, a display of swarm AI and openGL on the Android platform.


This project makes use of:

OpenGL ES,

In the source you will find examples of:

android services to play music,
dependency injection with views and POJO objects,

I hope this source will be helpful for people looking for a practical example of any of the above technologies in application.
